          I'm Abhijeet. ðŸ’¯ I acquired project and time management skills, as
          well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while
          effectively meeting milestones and deadlines. As a Full Stack
          developer I've worked both with startups and large corporations to
          help build & scale their companies. ðŸŒŸ Along the journey I realized my
          passion to code on a multitude of web based projects for a range of
          clients, providing Web Design and Development (C#, .NET Framework,
          MVC, Entity Framework, SQL Server Web API, HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery,
          React.js, Vue.js, Angular, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts). During my
          Masters Degree, I studied Computer Science, and therefore have a keen
          understanding of web development, object oriented programming and user
          experience design which I put to good use on every project I work on.
